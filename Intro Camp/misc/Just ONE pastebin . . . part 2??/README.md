# Just ONE pastebin . . . part 2??

## Problem Statement

MORE?

## Solution

This is a continuation of the first `Just ONE pastebin` challenge. We begin where we left off on the last challenge, at the YouTube video.

Video description directs you to search for "meow" in discord. The message containing "meow" directs you to the #announcements channel, at the top of which is a spoiler-ed message. That message directs you to the adv class page on cc website.

Also on the discord is the phrase (and a few hints):

> "The thing that goes bawk is a "

Append "chikin" from snocbeef's username, to get the full OTP pad:
`The thing that goes bawk is a chikin`

Decrypt to get plaintext:
`mr cat meow gobbles lottsa belvita`

There is yet another pastebin (https://pastebin.com/AJGANb6Y) on the Cyberclass website adv class page (https://sites.google.com/view/cyberclassroom/summer-programs/advanced-camp?authuser=0#h.uhzfx8cs6aiu). The password (as hinted below the place where the link is given, is the phrase about belvita that we just decrypted):

```
I wonder what music snopi listens to. I think about that a lot. I'm a fan. I'm the Helpful Pear! (Yeah im who youve been talking to this whole time) Welp you're almost there. But I don't care! Here are some fax about me NO PRINTER!!!!!! I like stars! I like to donk! I like stars that donk! I like the number **three**! I like peas! I like them less than carrots though.
What'd you say?
You want me to shut up??
Oho! You want the flag???? Too bad. I know one of snopi's friends has the password, but she'd probably only be willing to give it to you if you checked out the songs on the playlist she's been listening to this month..

Find the spotify with username snopi: https://open.spotify.com/user/nl8uty9fvzy3kwvom2uwztl27 

Look at her Followers list. Decrypt the last line which is a caesar cipher, for plaintext: It's the red anime profile picture

Find kot's June 2022 Spotify playlist under "Public Playlists," look at name of the **3rd** song title (POLAROID by Gidle)

Final [original] pastebin password: `POLAROID`
