# Just ONE pastebin

## Problem Statement
kotssu itches for games! I wonder what a snocbeef is. Anyway, this should be easy. Here's just the pastebin which has the flag: https://pastebin.com/5JmftNBn

https://pastebin.com/TT5TRwMq 

Wait why did you give me two???? Well the password for one of them is probably something stupid like password..

## Solution
Password for second pastebin is "password"

This pastebin asks what an "instant gram" is, and says "You might wanna save that bolded name you just found for laterâ€¦"
Find snocbeef instagram, see bolded username "chikin" and save this name.


Visit kot's itch.io: https://kotssu.itch.io/ and then go to https://kotssu.itch.io/owo-whats-this-sussy-baka 

Here is a secret message. "FYGTAURUPNOUHZIKMOPDASBGSDSBN" You can try to decrypt it but I bet you can't, not even ONE TIME! Even if you used 4000000000000 hours you couldn't. There's some more info you need that'll make it way easier. But basically you should just give up. Uhhh here's a youtube video you can watch on loop while you contemplate failure..
