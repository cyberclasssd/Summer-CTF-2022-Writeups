# BobLocksTM
## Problem Statement
Bob is inspired by Alice. He's going to upgrade his locks too! Unfortunately, he was inspired by the wrong person . . . 
## Solution
The n is too small, so totient of n can be easily found, and the modular inverse of e mod totient n can be calculated. Therefore, the private key can be calculated and the message can be decrypted character by character.
