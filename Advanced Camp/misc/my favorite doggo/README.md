## Problem Statement

THIS IS MY FAVORITE DOGGO. He is precious. Good at sending messages. Hiding secrets. Possibly... There may also be a secret message hidden in this photo of my FAVORITE DOGGO. 

Find the secret message. You may also find a flag.

## Solution
The problem statement indicates that a message is hidden inside the image we are given, presumably using something like steghide. We can use an online decoder like https://futureboy.us/stegano/ to find the message!

Uploading the image and hitting decode (no password needed) gives us the flag!

## Flag: ``flag{1t5_4_cut3_d0gg0_uWu}``. 

I love my dog don't you?
