# META (meat?!) eggs
## Problem Statement

I love the METAverse! Also i love META facebook company whatever whoever jeff bezos... meat is super yummy... do ya like my picture of eggs? They're so... META... aka epic

Find the flag. You may need to use some tools and some crypto knowledge.

## Solution
The continuous META in the problem statement indicates the flag may have something to do with METAdata. Plugging in the file to an online metadata viewer (https://www.metadata2go.com/) gives us a suspicious looking "Creator Tool" tab...

The "FLAGstaff, Arizona" is an indicator that the FLAG is located in the following hex digits: ``66 6C 61 67 7B 33 67 67 35 5F 34 72 33 5F 70 72 33 37 37 79 5F 33 70 31 63 5F 6D 48 6D 7D``. Decoding these digits from hex to ASCII gives the flag.


## Flag: ``flag{3gg5_4r3_pr377y_3p1c_mHm}``. 

I agree. Eggs are pretty epic.
